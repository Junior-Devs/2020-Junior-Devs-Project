# Contributing Guide

## General guidelines

If you wish to contribute to this project, please make sure you follow these guidelines. For those unfamiliar with Git/GitHub, read our [Git/GitHub guide](https://junior-devs.com/git-guide) and feel free to ask any questions on [Telegram](https://t.me/JuniorDevsBot)! Someone will gladly help you out.

1) Fork this repository ([How to?](https://junior-devs.com/git-guide))
2) Setup your Local Development Environment
    * Backend
        - See [here](https://github.com/Junior-Devs/2020-Junior-Devs-Project/wiki/Local-Database-Setup-for-Testing-Backend) how to set up the local database.
        - In the main directory, run `npm install`
        - Run `npm start`. If all went well you should see "NodeJS Server Running"
    * Frontend
        - `cd frontend`
        - Run `npm install` (the frontend and backend are two separate projects with separate `package.json` files, so you need to do this again inside the `frontend` directory
        - Run `npm run dev`. If all went well, you should see "Server running at http://localhost:1234". You can now open the project at http://localhost:1234.
3) Make the changes you wish to your local copy of the repository and push to your own fork
4) Make a pull request to the main [repository](https://github.com/Junior-Devs/2020-Junior-Devs-Project)

This guide is a work in progress. We will update it as we decide how our work process is going to be.
