# 2020-Junior-Devs-Project
2020 collaboration project for members of the Junior Devs group

## Purpose of this project
The main goal of this project is to enable members of the Junior Devs group to collaborate and learn valuable skills such as remote collaboration, practice their programming skills, learn new frameworks, and add a nice project to their portfolio, among other things.

All members of the group had a chance to add their ideas for a project to work on together, and we finally decided on one via a poll on the Telegram group. The details of the project are below. 

In the following days we will discuss how the work will be organize and more information will be added to this repository.
